                        February 16, a reversal by the Biden administration
                        which was welcomed by the United Nations and
                        humanitarian groups who feared former president Donald
                        Trump's actions would impede aid deliveries to the
                        conflict-torn country facing the world's worst
                        humanitarian crisis.

                        US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called President
                        Joe
                        Biden's decision to rescind the designation “a
                        recognition
                        of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen”. He said
                        the
                        new US administration listened to warnings from the
                        United
                        Nations, humanitarian groups, bipartisan members of
                        Congress
                        and others “that the designations could have a
                        devastating
                        impact on Yemenis' access to basic commodities like food
                        and
                        fuel”.
                        Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food, nearly all
                        purchased
                        through commercial channels, and UN humanitarian chief
                        Mark
                        Lowcock warned last month that the US designation of the
                        Houthis already had companies pulling back from dealing
                        with
                        the Yemenis and would likely lead to “a large-scale
                        famine
                        on a scale that we have not seen for nearly 40 years”.
                        Blinken's announcement followed a phone conversation on
                        Thursday with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,
                        where
                        Yemen was one of the issues they discussed. UN spokesman
                        Stephane Dujarric on Friday called the US action
                        “extremely
                        positive”. “We hope that helps build momentum for a
                        political solution to the conflict in Yemen,” Dujarric
                        said.
                        “I think the reversal of the designation, the naming of
                        the
                        [US] special envoy [for Yemen], and the clear, clear
                        language from the top of the administration, from
                        president
                        Biden himself, expressing his strong support for the
                        UN-led
                        mediation process [...] are very, very welcome indeed.”
                        In 2014, the rebel Houthis overran the capital, Sanaa,
                        and
                        much of Yemen's north, driving the government into
                        exile. A
                        US-backed, Saudi-led coalition intervened the following
                        year
                        to try and restore the internationally recognised
                        government, but years of UN efforts to get both sides to
                        agree to a ceasefire and start peace negotiations have
                        not
                        succeeded. The conflict has been disastrous for Yemen,
                        the
                        Arab world's poorest country, killing more than 112,000
                        people, creating a humanitarian disaster, and wrecking
                        infrastructure from roads and hospitals to water and
                        electricity networks.
                        The State Department confirmed last week that Biden was
                        moving to revoke the designation, a day after the
                        president
                        announced an end to offensive support to Saudi Arabia's
                        campaign against the Houthis.
